## Fundamentals

### Definition:

A first order ODE (i.e. Ordinary Differential Equation) has the following form

$$
{dy\over dx} = f(x, y)
$$

where y is the dependent variable and x is the independent variable.

### Separability:

An ODE is separable if and only if it can be written as

$$
\begin{aligned}
{dy \over dx} &= g(x) \cdot h(y) \\
\Longrightarrow {dy \over h(y) dx} &= g(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

so that it can be solved simply by taking integral at the both sides

$$
\int {dy \over h(y)dx} dx = \int g(x) dx
$$

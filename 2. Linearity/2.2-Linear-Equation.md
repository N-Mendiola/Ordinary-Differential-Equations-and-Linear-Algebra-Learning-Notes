## Linear Equation

### Definition

Given a linear operator $L$, an equation having the form

$$
L(x) = C
$$

is a linear equation, where $x$ can be a real number, a vector, or a function.

### Homogeneous Linear Equation

A linear equation $L(x) = C$ is homogeneous if and only if $C=0$

### Superposition Principle

#### Theorem

Given a homogeneous linear equation

$$
L(x) = 0
$$

if $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are both its solutions, their linear combinations are also the solutions of the equation.

#### Proof

Let $a$ and $b$ be two scalars. Applying the property of linear operator,

$$
L(ax_{1} + bx_{2}) = aL(x_{1}) + bL(x_{2}) = 0
$$

so $ax_{1} + bx_{2}$ is a solution of $L(x) = 0$.

### Non-homogeneous Principle

#### Theorem

Given a non-homogeneous linear equation

$$
L(x) = C
$$

if $x_{p}$ is a solution of it and $x_{h}$ is a solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation (i.e. $L(x) = 0$), then $x_{p} + x_{h}$ is also a solution of the non-homogeneous equation.

#### Proof

Applying the property of linear operator,

$$
L(x_{p} + x_{h}) = L(x_{p}) + L(x_{h}) = h + 0 = h
$$

so $x_{p} + x_{h}$ is a solution of $L(x) = h$.

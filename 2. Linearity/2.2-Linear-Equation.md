## Linear Equations

### Definition

Given a linear operator $L$, an equation having the form

$$
L(x) = C

$$

is a linear equation, where $x$ can be a real number, a vector, or a function.

### Homogeneous Linear Equation

A linear equation $L(x) = C$ is homogeneous if and only if $C=0$ .

### Superposition Principle

#### Theorem

Given a homogeneous linear equation

$$
L(x) = 0

$$

If $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are two solutions, and $a$ and $b$ are two real numbers, then $ax_{1} + bx_{2}$ are also solutions of the equations

#### Proof

Applying the property of linear operator,

$$
L(ax_1 + bx_2) = aL(x_1) + bL(x_2) = 0

$$

so $ax_{1} + bx_{2}$ is a solution of $L(x) = 0$ .

#### Notes:

- The proof doesn't require $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ to be distinct, so the theorem works even if we can only find one solution: if $x_{1}$ is a solution, and $a$ is a real number, then $ax_{1}$ is also a solution.

### Non-homogeneous Principle

#### Theorem

Given a non-homogeneous linear equation

$$
L(x) = C

$$

if $x_{p}$ is a solution of it and $x_{h}$ is a solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation (i.e. $L(x) = 0$), then $x_{p} + x_{h}$ is also a solution of the non-homogeneous equation.

#### Proof

Applying the property of linear operator,

$$
L(x_{p} + x_{h}) = L(x_{p}) + L(x_{h}) = h + 0 = h

$$

so $x_{p} + x_{h}$ is a solution of $L(x) = h$ .

#### Notes:

- We can also prove that: given a particular solution of the *non-homogeneous* solution $x_{p}$ and the solution set $X_h$ of the corresponded *homogeneous* equation,  the solution set of the *non-homogeneous* equation $X_n = \{x_{p} + x_{h}|x_{h}\in X_h\}$ . Here, the only thing we need to clarify in addition to the previous proofs is that any particular solution $x_q$ can be expressed as $x_q = x_{p} + x_{h}, x_{h}\in X_h$ .
  
  Since $x_p$ and $x_q$ are two solutions of the non-homogeneous equation, we have:
  
  $$
  \begin{cases}
L(x_p) = h \\
L(x_q) = h \\
\end{cases} \\
\Longrightarrow L(x_q - x_p) = L(x_q) - L(x_p) = 0 \\
\Longrightarrow x_q - x_p \in X_h
  $$
  
  Let $x_h = x_q - x_p$
  
  $$
  x_q = x_{p} + x_{h}, x_{h}\in X_h
  $$

### Linear Algebraic Equations

A linear algebraic equation has the form

$$
L(\boldsymbol{x}) = C
$$

where $L$ is a linear operator, and $\boldsymbol{x} = (x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})$ is a vector with its components corresponded to the unknown variables of the equation.

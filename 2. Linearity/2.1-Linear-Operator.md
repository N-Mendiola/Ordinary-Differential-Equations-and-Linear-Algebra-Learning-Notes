## Linear Operator

### Definition

An operator L is linear if and only if:

* $L(\boldsymbol{u}+\boldsymbol{v}) = L(\boldsymbol{u}) + L(\boldsymbol{v})$
* $cL(\boldsymbol{u}) = L(c\boldsymbol{u})$

In strict sense, we should specify that:

* $L: V \rightarrow W$, where $V$ and $W$ are two vector spaces over a same field $K$.
* $\boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{v} \in  V, c \in K$

##### Note

* A field is a set where addition and multiplication is well-defined among its elements.
* A vector space $V$ over a field $K$ is a set where addition is well-defined among $V$'s elements and multiplication is well-defined between an arbitrary element from $V$ and an arbitrary element from $K$. Then, elements of $V$ are referred as "vectors", and those of $K$ are referred as "scalars". This means that anything can be a vector and anything can be a scalar as long as the required operations are well-defined.
* To this point, we consider everything within the real number field $\mathbb{R}$, so we let $K = \mathbb{R}$. Also, we assume every "vector" have some conponents, they are denoted by $\boldsymbol{x}_i$, where $\boldsymbol{x}$ is a vector and $i$ is an integer.

### Simple Linear Operators:

* Scalar multiplication

$$
L(\boldsymbol{x}) = c\boldsymbol{x},\;c\in K
$$

* Identity to zero
  
  $$
  L(\boldsymbol{x}) \equiv 0
  $$

### Properties (can be shown easily)

* If $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ are two linear operators, $a$ and $b$ are two scalars, and $L_{3}(\boldsymbol{x}) \equiv aL_{1}(\boldsymbol{x}) + bL_{2}(\boldsymbol{x})$, then $L_{3}$ is also a linear operator.
* If $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ are two linear operators, and $L_{3}(\boldsymbol{x}) \equiv L_{2}(L_{1}(\boldsymbol{x}))$, then $L_{3}$ is also a linear operator.
* if $L_{1}\;...\;L_{n}$are all linear operators, $\boldsymbol{x}$ is an $n$-dimensional vector, and $L(\boldsymbol{x}) \equiv L_{1}(\boldsymbol{x}_{1}) + L_{2}(\boldsymbol{x}_{2}) + ... + L_{n}(\boldsymbol{x}_{n})$, then $L$ is also a linear operator.

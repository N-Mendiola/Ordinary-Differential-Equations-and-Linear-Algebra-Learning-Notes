## Linear Differential Equation

### Definition

Before further discussion, it is helpful to clarify the field and vector spaces we concern.

To this point, we consider all problems within the real number field $\mathbb{R}$. And because our differential operators work on functions, we consider the vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ formed by all functions $R \rightarrow R$. We may denote this space as $V$.

In this sense, the functions are "vectors" and all real numbers are "scalars". The addition and scalar multiplication are defined pointwise (i.e. $(\boldsymbol{f}+\boldsymbol{g})(x) := \boldsymbol{f}(x) + \boldsymbol{g}(x), (c\boldsymbol{f})(x) = \boldsymbol{f}(c \cdot x)$, where $c$ and $x$ are scalars).

Now, we may define linear differential equations as:

$$
L_{x}(\boldsymbol{y}) = \boldsymbol{q}\tag{1}
$$

where $L: V \rightarrow V$ is a linear operator involving derivatives or partial derivatives. $\boldsymbol{y}, \boldsymbol{q} \in V$ are two real functions dependent on $x$ and the operator itself may also be dependent on $x$.

Note: for clarity, we will use bold symbols for vectors (functions) in this passage. For example, $\boldsymbol{0}$ is a function that always maps to $0$. Also, we should note that a function $\boldsymbol{y}: R \rightarrow R$ is a vector but $\boldsymbol{y}(x)$ is a real number and thus a scalar. So, for simplicity, we use $y = \boldsymbol{y}(x)$ when $x$ is understood in the context.

### First Order Homogeneous Linear D.E.

#### Definition

A first order homogeneous linear D.E. has the the following explicit form:

$$
\begin{aligned}
{d\boldsymbol{y} \over dx} + p(x)\boldsymbol{y} = \boldsymbol{0}\tag{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

It's temptive to think that this explicit form is the general form. The correct general form is the inplicit form, which is:

$$
r(x){d\boldsymbol{y} \over dx} + h(x)\boldsymbol{y} = \boldsymbol{0}\tag{3}
$$

One may think that we can devide the both side by $r(x)$ and let ${h(x) \over r(x)} = p(x)$ to transform $(3)$ into $(2)$, but if $r(a) = 0$ we find that $(2)$ is not defined when $x=a$ but $(3)$ is. Yet, as long as we take care of $0$, we can always use the explicit form to solve problems.

#### Solving by the Separation of Variables

An explicit first order homogeneous linear D.E. can be solved easily by seperating variables:

Assuming $\boldsymbol{y} \ne \boldsymbol{0}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
{rrr}
\boldsymbol{y}' + p(x)\boldsymbol{y} &= \boldsymbol{0}\\
\;y' + p(x)y &= 0\\

\int {dy \over y dx} dx &= -\int p(x)dx\\

\ln|y| + C &= -\int p(x)dx\\

|y| &= e^{-\int p(x)dx - C}\\

\boldsymbol{y}(x) = y &= Ae^{-\int p(x)dx}\tag{4}
\end{aligned}
$$

where A is an arbitrary non-zero real number.

Additionally, the equilibrium solution is $\boldsymbol{y} = \boldsymbol{0}$ (i.e. $y \equiv 0$)

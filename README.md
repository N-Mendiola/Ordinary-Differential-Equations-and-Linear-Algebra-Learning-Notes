# Ordinary-Differential-Equations-and-Linear-Algebra-Learning-Notes

This is a Learning Note for Ordinary Differential Equations and Linear Algebra. Everyone is welcome to improve it.



For the notes, I recommand to use .md (Markdown) files. The greatest feature is that it supports Latex syntax for math formula. Of course, only some renderers can handle this. I recommand MarkText.

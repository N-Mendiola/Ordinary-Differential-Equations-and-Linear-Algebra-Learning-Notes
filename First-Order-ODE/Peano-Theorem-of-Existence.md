## Peano Theorem of Existence

### Theorem

If $D $ is an open subset of ${\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}} $, $f: D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a
continuous function, and $y'(x) = f(x, y)$ is an explicit first order ODE,

then, $\forall (x_{0}, y_{0}) \in D$, the initial value problem $y(x_{0}) = y_{0}$ must have a local solution.

##### Notes:

* $D $ is a region on the $xy $ plane. It is a set of initial conditions for which we guarantee a local solution.
* ${\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}} $ is the Cartesian product of the real number field with itself. Basically, it is the set of all 2-tuples $(x, y) $ such that $x \in R $ and $y \in R$.
* By saying that $f $ is continuous, we refer to the continuity of a multivariable function.
* A local solution is a solution defined on a neighborhood. By saying that the IVP $y(x_{0}) = y_{0}$ has a local solution, we guarantee the existence of a positive $\varepsilon$ such that at least one solution of the IVP is defined on $(x_{0} - \varepsilon, x_{0} + \varepsilon)$.
